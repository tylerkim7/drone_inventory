Note that in the above code, some arguments are specified
when creating a blueprint object.

The first argument, "site", is the Blueprint name as a string,
which is used by flask's routing mechanism.

The second argument __name__ is the Blueprint's import name,
which Flask uses to locate the Blueprint's resources.

The third is telling Flask where to find the html to render.
